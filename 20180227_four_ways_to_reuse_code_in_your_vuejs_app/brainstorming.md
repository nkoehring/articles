# 4 Ways to Reuse Code in your Vuejs App

Ways to reuse code in Vuejs:
 * Components
 * Directives
 * Mixins
 * Libraries / Packages
 * Filters

Steps:
 * Start with a simple task manager app written with everything in one file.
 * Introduce components and componentize the whole application. Show that this not only results in less lines of but also in more readable code.
 * Introduce Directives. They have more specialized usecases but can raise the readability of code drastically. Show that on a practical example.
 * Introduce Mixins. Show in a practical example, that they can make life easier and code more readable by creating reusable functionality that is injected into different components.
 * Introduce Packages. Show that (npm) packages are a form of code reuse, too and how Vue components can be put into a separate installable package.
 * Extra: Filters. There could be a short section about filters and how they are useful to reduce code duplication in some scenarios.

Example code should be completely in `Codesandbox` but the article should describe how to use `poi`, especially for the packages section. One additional topic will be data fetching from APIs.
