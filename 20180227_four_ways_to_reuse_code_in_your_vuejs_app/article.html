<p>Thanks to libraries like Vue, the rising complexity in web development stays manageable. One very important factor to that is, that it makes writing abstract and reusable code not only possible but also comfortable.</p>

<p>This article will show the most common ways of reusing code and tries to answer the most common questions: What is a good size for components before they should be split into smaller pieces? When is code big or complex enough to be separated and what are the possibilities besides components?</p>

<h2>Stars of web development: Components</h2>

<p>They are the new shining star in the firmament of web development: Web components. Developers always knew it is the right thing to write reusable abstract building blocks, especially if the result is a bigger piece of software. Unfortunately this is not easy to achieve for markup structures, especially if styling and logic are associated with them.</p>

<p>Web components solve this problem. They allow to encapsulate markup, styling and logic into one custom element which then can be reused many times. Libraries like <a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org">React</a> and <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org">Polymer</a> all introduce different variants of web components. While Polymer tries to stay as close as possible to the <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/specs">original specification</a>, React uses a functional and JavaScript centric approach. Vue stays somewhere in the middle with its Single File Components.</p>

<h3>Vue Single File Components</h3>

<p>Vue&#39;s single file components (SFC) help staying small and maintainable by combining markup, logic and styling into one file.</p>
