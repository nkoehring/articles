Dell XPS 15 with Void Linux
===========================

My journey on using the Dell XPS15 productive with VOID Linux.

What to expect
--------------

I started the preinstalled Windows and looked at the battery life: Windows 10
with default energy saving settings calculates 4h at 97%.

I didn't check for anything else.


pre installation
----------------

I checked other articles so see what I have to expect. Mainly
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=204739 and
https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2301071 .

They recommended to set the set the SATA Operation from RAID to AHCI and
disable secure boot â€” so I did.

I bootet the VOID live system without any graphical user interface. If you
don't want to squeeze your eyes together while in console, the first
thing to set on a HiDPI screen is the font.

```sh
setfont sun12x22
```

Just for fun, I checked the speed of the hard drive. It is a PCIe SSD, so it
should be pretty fast, and it is:

```sh
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nvme0n1 bs=16384 count=500000
```

Needs less than 15s, so it writes with around 550MB/s.

```sh
dd if=/dev/nvme0n1 of=/dev/null bs=16384 count=500000
```

Needs less than 9s. It reads with around 950MB/s.

Neat!

Now to the real problems: The system recognises the WiFi adapter (Broadcom) but
doesn't have drivers for it. The needed `brcmfmac` driver is available in Linux
4.5, but the VOID live system still uses 4.2.

Saving me the hassle of getting the WiFi to run in the Live system, I instead
took a USB ethernet card and used a good old RJ45 for installation.

I installed the system in the normal fashion but with everything inside an
encrypted container and I also skipped GRUB as I prefer to use the EFISTUB.

For more info on how to install Void manually with encrypted lvm, refer to
https://wiki.voidlinux.eu/Install_LVM_LUKS .

Bootup
------

Of course, booting initially didn't work at all. The problem is, that the UEFI
ignores entries made with `efibootmgr`. I didn't find any way to fix that, so I
downloaded `Shell.efi` from https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/ShellBinPkg/UefiShell/X64
and set up a boot entry to boot the EFI shell. I also created a `startup.nsh`
file in the EFI root. The EFI shell will now try to run the script
automatically.

Inside startup.nsh needs to be something like:
```
fs0:
/vmlinuz-linux root=UUID=3518bb68-d01e-45c9-b973-0b5d918aae96:luks root=/dev/pool/root initrd=/initramfs-linux.img rd.auto=1 rw
```

See https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EFISTUB#Booting_EFISTUB for more info.

The first startup took ages because the nouveau driver has problems with the
dual graphics setup. To fix this, I installed bumblebee and blocked the nouveau
driver. I also blocked the i2c_hdi module as described here:
https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2301071 and here:
http://wiki.yobi.be/wiki/Laptop_Dell_XPS_15#Working_after_manual_steps .

After first boot
----------------

Now all the services can be set up:

```sh
echo WPA_INTERFACE=wlp1s0 > /etc/sv/wpa_supplicant/conf
ln -s /etc/sv/wpa_supplicant /var/services
ln -s /etc/sv/dhcpcd /var/services
ln -s /etc/sv/bumblebeed /var/services
sv start wpa_supplicant
sv start bumblebeed
```

Lets also create a user, install sudo and screen and go from there:

```sh
xbps-install -S sudo screen
groupadd $USER
useradd -g $USER -G wheel,disk,audio,video,kvm,users,bumblebee -s /bin/zsh $USER
passwd $USER
visudo
# uncomment or add following line:
# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL

```

Log into your fancy new user account!

Getting Xorg running
--------------------

Install the needed packages for Xorg:

```sh
xbps-install -S xinit xorg-minimal xrdb xset xsetroot xterm xorg-fonts xf86-video-intel nvidia xf86-input-synaptics
# nice additions
xbps-install -S feh xsecurelock i3-gaps i3blocks st rofi dunst font-awesome compton
```

Find lots of example configuration at my configs repo: https://github.com/nkoehring/configs.git

If you want to set the keyboard layout in Xorg via config files, have a look
at: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Keyboard_configuration_in_Xorg#Setting_keyboard_layout

Settings for the touchpad to work: TODO

I also looked at https://wiki.voidlinux.eu/Proprietary_Video_Drivers#Optimus
about setting up video drivers. Not sure yet if it is really the right spot as
I had to set the default device for screen 0 to intel.

Power Management
----------------

In a comment at https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1581321#p1581321
the user Utini wrote about his power management setup.

Afteer setting up the powersaving `acpi -b` reported 4h20m battery lifetime.
