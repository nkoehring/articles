Productivity in the console. Today: spreadsheets with teapot.
=============================================================

As a consolero today it is not always easy to find a useful solution for some
problems. One example are spreadsheets.

So, what now?
-------------

Of course there are some programs but the most useful ones are typically GUI
software. If you additionally get some Microsoft Excel vomit, you completely
lacking possibilites …aren't you?

No, there are ways to handle that, as long as you don't need fancy pie charting
or the like.

What you need:
 * a way to convert the vomit to some readable format – like CSV,
 * a useful CUI spreadsheet program!

There are different ways to convert XLS files. One would of course be to simply
ask the Microsoft chained guy for it. Another way is to use the Perl program 
xls2csv¹ or any graphical and/or web based solution. For the challenge I just
leave the details to the reader.

Now, if you have a useful format, open it with a nifty CUI program. There are
some console based spreadsheet programs and as far as I know two of them are
worth to look at. One is sc² and the other on teapot³.

The latter is the one I like more and so it is of interest for this article.

What can I do with teapot?
--------------------------

The name Teapot derives from "Table Editor And Planner". It can handle
spreadsheets in three dimensions and they say it is for "mathy" people.

Actually, I think teapot is not that much more mathy then any other spreadsheet
program. The big difference is, that you address cells with three dimensional
coordinates like 3,5,0 instead of a letter-number combination or the even worse
3D addressing of excel which uses the name of the table.

One more thing: The values in cells are typed. That means, if you want a plain
string inside a cell, you need to type it in "quotes". Anything else is
recognised either as function or as label (more on these later).

Now if you have a simple spreadsheet to calculate the income you expect out of
your super legal business, you can do that in a view simple steps.

One more thing to mention before: Teapot works with command and input modes. To
switch to input mode, just press enter on any cell. Inside the command mode,
you will probably do most of your stuff via the menu, which you reach via F10
or /.

So, remember that converted excel vomit? Lets open it!

> teapot
Press / or F10 to get into the Menü. The quick way is now pressing F and L,
means: File → Load. You can now just enter the filename. Tab completion works
here. Loading the file directly at startup works only with teapot files, as it
seems.

So, what we see now, could look like this:
