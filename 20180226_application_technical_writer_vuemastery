Hi Gregg,

I have to admit, it took me quite some time. I worked myself through a good amount of articles and websites, even obscure ones. I realised, I had barely any idea about the topic. But eventually I learned something new about myself and can tell you: My spirit animal is The Crow!

With the crow on my side it is only natural that I am gravitating towards VueMystery, I mean …VueMastery. My intention to uncover the magic of Vue is obvious. I already started with explaining the mysteries of the underlying reactivity system¹ and even showed how to cast similar spells. I plan to write more articles like this, maybe bring to light the dark magic behind Vuex or the Vue Router. After "Vuejs Reactivity from scratch" I could write "Vuex deciphered" or "Exploring the Vue Router". My current side project is to make Maps with Vuejs easier. So I will definitely write about that too: "Navigating with VEM: Vue Easy Maps".

I didn't only write about Vuejs though. My blog shows, that I have a broad interest. Others would say, I cannot decide what I am interested in. I think I'm just interested in most of the things, for example in security topics².

Another Vuejs-related thing I am active in is the Vuejs community. I organise the monthly Vuejs Meetup in Berlin³ and I am in contact with related communities in Amsterdam, Oslo and Prague.

My professional experience with Vuejs is not falling short either. Although its use is not very widespread in Berlin (yet) I was lucky to find two freelance projects in a row that use Vuejs. One is FromAtoBs⁴ booking and payment pages that I rewrote together with my collegue. My current project is part of SmartOffice⁵, a project of HERE Technologies, where I create an interactive floor plan. Other things I did can be found on Github, where I am as nkoehring⁶.

I'm sorry for that long mail but there is one more thing I find worth to mention: I didn't do it since a few months but I used to mentor Ruby and JavaScript programming in different projects like RailsGirls⁷, Jugend Hackt⁸ and Frauenloop⁹/Refugees on Rails. Hopefully I will find the time to do this again.

If you made it until this point, I want to thank you. I hope you found some interesting bits and pieces and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.
